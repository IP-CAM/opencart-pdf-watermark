Installation Guide - PDF Watermark

This modification is for OpenCart Version 1.5x


1. Unzip the archive.
2. copy files in upload to your opencart root.

When your custormers download a PDF file it will watermark each page with a text header and footer.
The header consists of user details such as their name, email and telephone number.
The footer contains the date downloaded and a md5 hash of the download details.

Your PDFs will need to have some white space at the top and bottom for the pages for the watermarks to be clearly visible.


If you want to change the text colour, font, or text; you're going to have to edit the file /catalog/controller/account/fpdf/mpdf.php by hand. Make sure you back up your files!
